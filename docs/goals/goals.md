# Goals & Roadmap
This section serves to give an overview of my current goals and future roadmap. It’s a place to document progress, share ambitions, and reflect openly on where things are heading.

By outlining milestones, active priorities, and long-term plans, I aim to stay focused, adapt intentionally, and maintain transparency in my journey. Whether it's refining strategy, building tools, or navigating setbacks, this roadmap is a living document of purpose, discipline, and growth.
