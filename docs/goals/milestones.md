# Roadmap
By outlining milestones, active priorities, and long-term plans, I aim to stay focused, adapt intentionally, and maintain transparency in my journey. Whether it's refining strategy, building tools, or navigating setbacks, this roadmap is a living document of purpose, discipline, and growth.

## Milestones (passed challenge, scaling account, etc.)
The first step of the FTMO Evaluation Process has been completed.
