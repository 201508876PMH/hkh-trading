# Purpose
This page provides a walkthrough of the FTMO experience ‚Äî from starting the challenge to becoming a funded trader. It highlights key milestones and the journey toward professional trading.

## What is the FTMO challenge?
FTMO is one of the world‚Äôs leading proprietary trading firms. They give traders access to large amounts of capital ‚Äî but only after proving they can trade consistently and responsibly.

The FTMO Challenge is the first step in their evaluation process. Here‚Äôs how it works:

* ‚úÖ You trade a demo account with up to $200,000 in virtual capital.
* üìä You must reach a profit target (e.g., 10%) within a limited number of trading days.
* üõë While staying within strict risk limits, like maximum daily loss and maximum overall loss.
* ‚è±Ô∏è There‚Äôs no pressure to overtrade ‚Äî you just have to trade smart.

If you pass the challenge and the following verification phase, you become an FTMO-funded trader, managing real capital and earning up to 90% of the profits you generate.
